When writing code make sure to follow these guidelines:
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
- Follow the existing code style and structure for consistency.
- Favor code re-use and modularity; create new components or hooks when necessary.
- Favor data driven design; use configuration files or constants for static data, oviding hard-coded values.
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback.
